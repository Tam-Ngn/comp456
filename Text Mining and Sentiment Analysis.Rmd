## Background and Resources -- Cecelia
-- tidy text analysis (why do we want to do this?)
-- sentiment analysis 
-- the package (gutenbergr and what is it)
-- popular functions (and what they do)
-- resources to extend learning
- different lexicons
-- reminder about joins



## Practice
## Demo of popular function
(unest_tokens(), joins for the tibbles)
- ok your turn!! --> Decide which book or books!
-- testing correlation
-- maybe give an optional challenge problem from the later chapters?

Everything we have taught into one activity
